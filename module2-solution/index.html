                    <p>Now is the winter of our discontent
                        Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
                        And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
                        In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
                        Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
                        Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
                        Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
                        Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
                        Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;</p>
